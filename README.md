# CodeChallenge

<p> You are planning a big programming conference and have received many proposals which have passed the initial screen process but you're having trouble fitting them into the time constraints of the day -- there are so many possibilities! So you write a program to do it for you.

<ul>
<li> The conference has multiple tracks each of which has a morning and afternoon session. </li>
<li> Each session contains multiple talks. </li>
<li> Morning sessions begin at 9am and must finish by 12 noon, for lunch. </li>
<li> Afternoon sessions begin at 1pm and must finish in time for the networking event. </li>
<li> The networking event can start no earlier than 4:00 and no later than 5:00. </li>
<li> No talk title has numbers in it. </li>
<li> All talk lengths are either in minutes (not hours) or lightning (5 minutes). </li>
<li> Presenters will be very punctual; there needs to be no gap between sessions.</li>
</ul>
Note that depending on how you choose to complete this problem, your solution may give a different ordering or combination of talks into tracks. This is acceptable; you don’t need to exactly duplicate the sample output given here.
